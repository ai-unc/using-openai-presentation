				Generative artificial intelligence (AI) models are a type of LLM that can be used to create new content such as code, images, text, simulations, and
				videos.
			</li>
			<li>Used to automatically generate content, such as articles, blog posts, or social media posts.</li>
			<li>ChatGPT is a LLM.</li>
			<li>More about LLM's, they are based on transformers, which is a neural network invented by Google.</li>
			<li>Transformer architecture scales effectively. Why is it called large? Train on large text datasets.</li>
			<li>What makes LLM's powerful is one model can be used for a wide variety of tasks.</li>
			<li>How to use LLM's? Comes down to figuring out what text to feed it to get it to perform the behavior you are looking for</li>
